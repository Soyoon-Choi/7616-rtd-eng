# 3. Managing Adapter for Oracle

This chapter describes how to start up and shut down oraAdapter and how to use the Adapter for Oracle Utility

### oraAdapter Constraints

There are various constraints in using oraAdapter(or oraAdapter). If the following conditions are not satiafied, oraAdapter will not be able to use.

#### Preliquisites

-   If a conflict occurs when executing INSEART/UPDATE/DELETE in the target database(Oracle or other altibase), the execution is cancelled and a message is left to an error log file or the execution is neglected in accordance with the configuration. 
-   An error which was occurred during the replication can be withdrawn. That is to say, if there is a duplicated data when inserting multiple data, the execution is completed except the duplicated data. 
-   The replication speed might be slower than that of the service.

#### Data Constraints

-   Primary key is required in the table to be replicated.
-   To be replicated, primary key of the table cannot be modified.
-   Tables to be replicated on both servers must have the same order and primary key constraints.

#### Connection Constraints

-   The maximum number of possible replication connection for XLog Sender and replication per one ALTIBASE HDB database is determined by specified value of REPLICATION_MAX_COUNT property

#### Allowed DDL Statements

In general, replication target tables cannot execute the data definition language(DDL). However, the followings statemsnts are able to excute DDL regardless of XLog Sender. Refer to the Executing DDL Statements on Replication Target Tables of deploying replication section in the *Replication Manual* for other allowable DDL statements.

-   ALTER INDEX REBUILD PARTITION

-   GRANT OBJECT

-   REVOKE OBJECT

-   CREATE TRIGGER

-   DROP TRIGGER

#### Allowable DDL Statements on Target Replication Tables

Generally, if DDL is executed in a replication target table, all modifications made before the current DDL are applied to the database, and then the databse is terminated. Once oraAdapter(altiAdapter) is terminated, the replication can be executed by re-starting oraAdapter(altiAdapter) after making table schemas identical through executing the same DDL on the target database.

Refer to the Executing DDL Statements in the *Replicaiton Manual* for other allowed DDL statements.

### Startup and Shutdown

This section describes how to startup and shutdown oraAdapter.

#### Startup

How to run oraAdapter will be explained step by step.

In order to use oraAdapter, Altibase and the Oracle DB must first both be running. Additionally, verify that the Adapter for Oracle property settings and environment variables have been set appropriately for the environment in which oraAdapter will be run.

If any environment variables or property settings are changed after oraAdapter has been started, it will be necessary to restart oraAdapter in order to apply the changes. For more information on setting environment variables, please refer to Post-installation Tasks in Chapter Two.

1. Check whether the Altibase REPLICATION_PORT_NO property[^1] has been set to a port number that is available for replication. If it is necessary to change this property setting, Altibase has to be restarted after the new value is given.
  
   [^1]: REPLICATION_PORT_NO specifies the replication port number of a local server for a replication connection. For more detail about this property, please refer to the [General Reference](https://github.com/ALTIBASE/Documents/blob/master/Manuals/Altibase_7.3/eng/General%20Reference-1.Data%20Types%20%26%20Altibase%20Properties.md#replication_port_no).  

2. Before starting oraAdapter, it is also necessary to configure the XLog Sender so that the Altibase Log Analyzer (ALA) can be used. The XLog Sender is used to send XLogs and Meta information from Altibase. FOR ANALYSIS PROPAGATION is used to send logs from the transactions replicated with PROPAGABLE LOGGING to another server.
   In the following statement, an XLog Sender is created so that the data in table t1, which belongs to the sys user in Altibase, can be replicated to table t2, which belongs to the user scott in the Oracle DB.

```
CREATE REPLICATION ala FOR ANALYSIS WITH '127.0.0.1', 25090
                                            FROM sys.t1 TO scott.t2;
```

3. Now it is time to start oraAdapter. oraAdapter can be started either by executing it directly, or using the Adapter for Oracle Utility. For detailed information on how to start oraAdapter using the Adapter for Oracle Utility, please refer to the Adapter for Oracle Utility section later in this chapter. In LINUX, the oraAdapter can be started using the command below:

```
$ cd $ORA_ADAPTER_HOME/bin
$ ./oraAdapter
```

4. If oraAdapter starts normally, you can check the start time and message in oraAdapter.trc file.

```
$ cat $ORA_ADAPTER_HOME/trc/oraAdapter.trc
[2016-07-26 15:53:12] Altibase Adapter started.
```

5. Start XLog sender for Altibase Log Analyzer. If you try to start the XLog sender before running oraAdapter, it will fail. When the XLog sender is executed, shake hands with the oraAdapter to check the authentication procedure. When the handshake is executed normally and the oraAdapter is ready to be cloned, you can check the ready message in the oraAdapter.trc file.


```
$ cat $ORA_ADAPTER_HOME/trc/oraAdapter.trc
[2016-07-26 20:52:51] Adapter is ready to process logs.
iSQL> ALTER REPLICATION ala START;
```




#### Shutdown

The process of shutting down oraAdapter includes the process of stopping the operation of the XLog Sender. If oraAdapter is shut down forcefully using the Adapter for Oracle Utility, it will be shut down successfully, but the Altibase XLog Sender will continue to attempt to connect to oraAdapter.

```
iSQL> ALTER REPLICATION ala STOP;
Alter success.
```



### Data Types

When data in Altibase are applied to an Oracle DB, the data types are converted as shown in the following table.

| Altibase            | Oracle DB            | Additional Information for Oracle DB |
| ------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| FLOAT               | NUMBER               |                                      |
| NUMERIC             | NUMBER               |                                      |
| DOUBLE              | NUMBER               | BINARY_DOUBLE can also be used.      |
| REAL                | NUMBER               | BINARY_FLOAT can also be used.       |
| BIGINT              | NUMBER               |                                      |
| INTEGER             | NUMBER               |                                      |
| SMALLINT            | NUMBER               |                                      |
| DATE                | DATE                 |                                      |
| CHAR                | CHAR                 |                                      |
| VARCHAR             | VARCHAR2             |                                      |
| NCHAR<br />NVARCHAR | NCHAR<br />NVARCHAR2 |                                      |

[Table 3-1] Data Type Conversion

#### Example

The following example illustrates how the data types are converted when data in Altibase are applied to an Oracle DB, assuming that the National Character Set has been set to UTF-16. 

Assuming that the data types in Altibase have been set as follows:

```
CREATE TABLE T1(
    A1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    A2  CHAR(20),
    A3  VARCHAR(20),
    A4  NCHAR(20),
    A5  NVARCHAR(20)
    );
```

The data types in the Oracle DB would be set as shown below.

```
CREATE TABLE T1(
    A1 NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    A2 CHAR(20),
    A3 VARCHAR2(20),
    A4 NCHAR(20),
    A5 NVARCHAR2(20)
    );
```



### Adapter for Oracle Utility

Adapter for Oracle Utility (oaUtility) is a script that runs oraAdapter as a daemon and check its status. This script runs in a bash shell installed with GNU sed. 

The Adapter for Oracle Utility supports the following options:

-   oaUtility start

-   oaUtility stop

-   oaUtility status

-   oaUtility check

#### oaUtility Prerequisites

To make oaUtility work properly, the user needs to check the following:

-   oraAdapter is controlled using sed, grep, ps, wc, iSQL (Altibase), and SQLPlus (Oracle) commands based on the Bash Shell. OaUtility works normally when all the utilities are installed and can be executed.
-   oaUtility is affected by personal preferences. Therefore, if the environment variable or personal environment (login.sql, glogin.sql) is set, initialize or change the path to prevent oaUtility from being affected.

#### oaUtility start

##### Syntax

```
oaUtility {start [ force ]}
```

##### Description

This is used to start oraAdapter as a daemon. The force option starts the oraAdapter without checking for a primary key constraint in the replication target table.


#### oaUtility stop

##### Syntax

```
oaUtility {stop}
```

##### Description

This is used to forcefully terminate the Adapter for Oracle process. 

#### oaUtility status

##### Syntax

```
oaUtility {status}
```



##### Description

This is used to check whether oraAdapter is running.

#### oaUtility check

##### Syntax

```
oaUtility { check [ alive | constraints] }
```



##### Description

If either the alive or constraints option is specified, oaUtility continually checks whether oraAdapter is running, and if it has been shut down (regardless of whether it was shut down normally or forcibly), restarts it. 

If either the alive or constraints option is specified, the corresponding task is performed only once, and then oaUtility shuts down (i.e. does NOT perform continual checking). Specifying the alive option tells oaUtility to check whether oraAdapter is running. 

Specifying the constraints option tells oaUtility to check whether each of the primary keys in the tables to be ported from Altibase to Oracle DB are defined consistently, i.e. on the basis of columns having the same name.

### Command-Line Options

The following command-line options are supported for use with oraAdapter.

#### Syntax

```
oraAdapter [ -v | -version ]
```



#### Description

Replication can be prepared by directly executing the binary of oraAdapter (altiAdapter).

#### Example

```
$./oraAdapter -v
Altibase Adapter for Oracle version 5.5.1.1.2
...
```



Appendix A: FAQ
=========

### FAQ

#### What do I have to do after I change an environment variable or a property?

Once oraAdapter has been started, if any environment variables or properties are changed, it will be necessary to restart oraAdapter in order to implement the changes.

#### What if the data are not successfully applied to the Oracle DB?

If oraAdapter fails to write a data item to the Oracle DB, it merely writes a log message and proceeds to the next data item. This log message will be left in a trace log file in the '$ORA_ADAPTER_HOME/trc' directory.

Appendix B: DDL order when using oraAdapter
