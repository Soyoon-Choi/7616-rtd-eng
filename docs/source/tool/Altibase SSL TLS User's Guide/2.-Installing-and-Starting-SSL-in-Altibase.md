# 2. Installing and Starting SSL in Altibase

This chapter provides instructions for installing SSL and the necessary software.

### Software Requirements

This section describes the requirements for using SSL communication on the server and client.

#### Server

-   OpenSSL toolkit 3.0.8
-   Altibase version 7.3.0.0.0 or later

To use SSL/TLS in Altibase, the OpenSSL toolkit is required. This toolkit was developed by the OpenSSL Project and can be downloaded from http://www.openssl.org/source. Altibase 7.3 no longer supports OpenSSL 1.0.x, but supports OpenSSL 3.0.8.

#### Client

##### ODBC

The OpenSSL toolkit has to be installed in order to use the SSL communication with ODBC.

##### JDBC

To conveniently implement the client Java application through SSL, it is recommended to use Java 1.8.0_351 or later. This version is preferred for the following reasons:

- In Java 1.8.0_351 or later, TLS 1.3 cipher algorithms can be used without any specific setting.

- Since  Java 1.8.0_261 it supports TLS 1.3. However, the following setting is required to use TLS 1.3.

  ```java
    % java -Djdk.tls.client.protocols="TLSv1.3"
  ```

### Configuring the Environment for SSL

This section discusses how to configure the environment for Altibase SSL.

-   Configure SSL on the Server

-   Configure the Environment for SSL

-   Configure SSL for ODBC

#### Configure SSL on the Server

-   Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its Library
-   Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL
-   Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication
-   Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority
-   Step 5: Start the Server

##### Step 1: Confirm the Installation of OpenSSL and its Library
It is recommended to install the OpenSSL toolkit before installing SSL-enabled Altibase. Otherwise, if an Altibase function is used and the OpenSSL is not installed, Altibase reports that it is unable to find the OpenSSL library.

Check if that OpenSSL is installed on the server and verify that the version is as shown below.

```
$ openssl version
OpenSSL 3.0.8 7 Feb 2023 (Library: OpenSSL 3.0.8 7 Feb 2023)
```

##### Step 2: Set Server Properties to Connect over SSL

To connect over SSL within Altibase, you need to set the following properties located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/altibase.properties file. For more detailed information, please refer to the *General Reference*.

-   SSL_ENABLE  
    : Switches the SSL feature on or off within Altibase. To enable, set the value to 1. 
-   SSL_PORT_NO  
    : Specifies the listening port number for SSL connections. The value must be unique. 
-   SSL_MAX_LISTEN  
    : Sets the listen queue maximum size for concurrent SSL connections. You should note that more listeners require more memory.
-   SSL_CIPHER_LIST  
    : The candidate cipher algorithm list available for the server and client to use and negotiate with. Depending on your security policy, you can specify one or more cipher names and separate them by colons. The user can check the list at OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) or execute the following command in the shell environment.

```
$ openssl ciphers
```

- SSL_CIPHERS_SUITES  
  : This property defines the list of TLS 1.3 ciphers. If left unset, all cipher lists allowed by OpenSSL are used.

- SSL_LOAD_CONFIG

  : Set this property to load the OpenSSL configuration file(openssl.cnf). The default value is 0, which disables this feature. To use the OpenSSL FIPS module, set the value of this property to 1.

  * 0: Do not load OpenSSL configuration file 
  * 1: Load OpenSSL configuration file

##### Step 3: Specify SSL Client Authentication

-   SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION  
    : Sets the SSL authentication mode to server-only authentication or mutual authentication. If the user sets the value to 1 for mutual authentication, the server will request a certificate from the client during the SSL handshake.

##### Step 4: Set Server Certificate, Private Key, and Certificate Authority

-   SSL_CERT

-   SSL_KEY

-   SSL_CA

-   SSL_CAPATH

###### SSL_CERT

Sets the server certificate path.

For example, if the name of a server certificate is server-cert.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server-cert.pem.

###### SSL_KEY

Sets the server private (secret) key path.

For example, if the name of a server’s secret key is server-key.pem and it is located in the $ALTIBASE_HOME/cert directory, the value for this property is ?/cert/server- key.pem.

###### SSL_CA, SSL_CAPATH

The SSL_CA or SSL_CAPATH property must be set in order to receive ownership of the CA certificate issued by an accredited authority. The CA certificate file is located in a user-specified path or a directory in X.509 format.

If you don’t have an accredited certificate, you can use SSL by creating a private certificate. 

##### Step 5: Start the Server

Start SSL-enabled Altibase. Please refer to the sample files provided in the Appendix.

If SSL_ENABLE is set to 1, the SSL listen port is displayed as follows. This means that both the environment variables ALTIBASE_PORT_NO and ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO need to be defined. 

```
$server start

#### Configure SSL for JDBC

-   Step 1: Import Certificates

-   Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

-   Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

##### Step 1: Import Certificates

The first step is to import certificates into the truststore for the server's CA certificate or into the keystore for its own CA certificate and secret key. Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE) uses the truststore and keystore for authentication.

The next step to take depends on whether the CA certificate type is public or private and the job thereafter depends on whether the chosen authentication mode is server-only authentication or mutual authentication.

1.  Private certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

2.  Private certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the server's CA certificate into the truststore. Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.
    
3.  Public certificates with server-only authentication mode:  
    No action is necessary.

4.  Public certificates with mutual authentication mode:  
    Import the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own CA certificate and secret key, into the keystore.

When using private certificates (1 or 2 above), import the server's CA certificate into the truststore.

```
$keytool -import -alias alias_name -file server_certificate_file.pem -keystore truststore -storepass password
```

For 2 or 4, prior to importing its certificate and secret key, ensure that the PKCS #12 formatted file, containing its own certificate and secret key, is ready.

If the PKCS #12 file is not ready, execute OpenSSL with the pkcs12 option to generate the PKCS #12 file which contains the client's certificate and secret key as follows.

```
$openssl pkcs12 -export -in client_certificate.pem -inkey client_secretkey_file.pem > pkcs_file.p12
```

Import the prepared PKCS #12 file into the keystore with the following options. <sup>1</sup>

[<sup>1</sup>] You can only import .pem files into keystore with the '-importkeystore' option.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks -srcstoretype pkcs12
```

##### Step 2: Set up Authentication in a Java Environment

JRE must access the truststore and keystore for authentication over SSL. The user can select from any of the following three configurations.

-   Configure a Java Application's Command-line Option

-   Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

-   Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application 

###### Configure a Java Application’s Command-line Option

```
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStore=path_to_keystore
-Djavax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword=password
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=path_to_truststore
-Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=password
```

###### Use the System.setProperty Method in a Java Application

```
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStore", "path_to_keystore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.keyStorePassword", "password");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStore", "path_to_truststore");
System.setProperty("javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword", "password");
```

###### Configure the JDBC Property in a Java Application

```
Properties sProp = new Properties();
sProps.put("keystore_url", "path_to_keystore");
sProps.put("keystore_password", "password");
sProps.put("truststore_url", "path_to_truststore");
sProps.put("truststore_password", "password");
```

##### Step 3: Set JDBC Properties for SSL

Altibase provides JDBC for SSL connection to use SSL within the database. JDBC properties are categorized into the following two groups:

-   JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

-   JDBC Properties for Authentication

###### JDBC Properties for SSL Connections

| Name             | Description                                                  | Range            | Default Value                                                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ssl_enable       | Specifies whether or not to connect to the database over SSL connection. An SSL connection is created if this value is true; a TCP connection is created if this value is false. | [true \| false ] | false                                                        |
| port             | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. The priority for an SSL port number is: 1) if ssn_enable is true and a value has been specified, this value is applied first. 2) if ssn_enable is true and this value is omitted, the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable is applied. 3) if ssn_enable is true and both this value and the ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO environment variable are omitted, the default value (20300) is applied. | 0 \~ 65535       | ssl_enable(false): 20300 ssl_enable(ture): 20443             |
| ciphersuite_list | This is a list of available ciphers. Each name is separated by a colon (e.g., SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_MD5:SSL _RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA). If JRE does not support the named algorithm, an IllegalArgumentException with the "Unsupported ciphersuite" message is thrown. | String           | [All cipher suite lists supported by JRE](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html) |
| ssl_protocols    | This is a list of protocols used for SSL communication on the server. Users can set several protocols using commas(e.g., TLSv1.2,TLSv1.3). | String           | [All SSL/TLS protocols supported by JRE](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/SunProviders.html)) |

###### JDBC Properties for Authentication

| Name                      | Description                                                  | Range                      | Default Value |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| verify_server_certificate | Specifies whether or not to authenticate the target server's CA certificate. To use SSL exception authentication, set as false and the client application will not authenticate the server's CA certificate. In this case, it is unnecessary to import the server's private CA certificate for authentication. | [ true \| false ]          | true          |
| keystore_url              | Specifies the path to the keystore (a container for its own private key and the certificates with their corresponding public keys). | String                     | N/A           |
| keystore_type             | Specifies the keystore type for keystore_url. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | [ JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc] | JKS           |
| keystore_password         | Specifies the password for keystore_url.                     | String                     | N/A           |
| truststore_url            | Specifies the path to the truststore (a keystore containing certificates that belong to the communication partners). | String                     | N/A           |
| truststore_type           | Specifies the truststore type at truststore_url above. Java Key Store (JKS) is the most common type in Java. | [JKS, JCEKS, PKCS12, etc]  | JKS           |
| truststore_password       | Specifies the password to truststore_url above.              | String                     | N/A           |

##### Step 4: Set Altibase Environment Variables

Altibase sets the port number for SSL communication, and this step can be omitted. 

If the port property has not been set for JDBC, the value specified for ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO will be used as the port number. If ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO is omitted, the default value for the port property is used. 

| Name                 | Description                                         | Value                | Default Value |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------- |
| ALTIBASE_SSL_PORT_NO | Specifies the SSL port number on the target server. | Range: 1024 \~ 65535 | N/A           |

##### Considerations When Using SSL with JDBC

Please consider the following when using SSL for JDBC.

###### Importing the PKCS #12 File into the Keystore

To use mutual authentication over SSL, you must first import the client's CA certificate and private key into the KeyStore. Users can import PKCS #12 using the -importkeystore option of keytool as shown below.

```
$keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore pkcs_file.p12 -destkeystore keystore.jks
-srcstoretype pkcs12
```

#### Configure SSL for ODBC

-   Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

-   Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

-   Step 3:  Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

-   Step 4: Set the Altibase Environment Variables

-   Step 5: Write a Client Program

##### Step 1: Verify the OpenSSL Library

You need the OpenSSL library to use SSL in ODBC. ODBC reads the OpenSSL library and calls the necessary functions while connecting to the server. Therefore, you should verify that the OpenSSL library has been installed properly, before writing a client application. Where the library is installed can differ among operating systems.

-   Verify the library installation

```
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libssl*
$ ls -al /usr/lib/libcrypto*
```

-   Verify the utility installation

```
$ openssl version
```

##### Step 2: Prepare the Client’s Certificate

Prepare the client’s certificate and secret key in a pem format file for mutual authentication of the server and client. The location of these files should be accessible by a client using ODBC.

##### Step 3: Set ODBC/CLI Properties for SSL

You need to set SSL properties appropriately, before writing a client program using SSL. The client can specify the following properties as a connection string when connecting to the server. Refer to the sample program for usage.

SSL connection properties are located in $ALTIBASE_HOME/conf/altibase.properties. 

| Name       | Description                                                  | Range        | Default Value |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ | ------------- |
| SSL_CA     | Specifies the file path to store CA certificates to certify the ownership of received certificates. CA certificates can exist in a user-specific file path or a X.509 structured directory. <br/>Ex)SSL_CA= /cert/ ca-cert.pem. | None         | NULL          |
| SSL_CAPATH | Specifies CAPATH in a CA directory format. <br/>Ex) SSL_CAPATH=/etc/ssl/certs | None         | NULL          |
| SSL_CERT   | Sets the Altibase certificate path. </br>Ex)SSL_CERT=/cert/client-cert.pe m | None         | NULL          |
| SSL_KEY    | Sets the server private (secret) key path. <br/>Ex) SSL_KEY=/cert/client-key.pem | None         | NULL          |
| SSL_VERIFY | Sets whether or not to authenticate the server certificate. An SSL handshake fails if authentication fails, and it becomes impossible to communicate over SSL. <br/>0 : (OFF) Does not authenticate the server certificate <br/>1: (ON) Authenticates the server certificate <br/>Ex) SSL_VERIFY=0 | 0: OFF 1: ON | 0 (off)       |
| SSL_CIPHER | A cipher algorithms available for the server and client to use and negotiate with. Depending on your security policy, you can specify one or more cipher names and separate them by colons(:). You can check the list at OpenSSL (http://www.openssl.org/) or execute the following command in the shell environment. $ openssl ciphers <br/>Ex)SSL_CIPHER=EDH-DSS-DESCBC-SHA:DES-CBC-SHA | None         | NULL          |

The following is a table comparing the server SSL properties and ODBC/CLI properties.

| Name                      | Server(altibase.properties) | ODBC/CLI                                                     |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| SSL_ENABLE                | O                           | X<br/>The client is same meaning with SSL_ENABLE = 1 if CONNTYPE = SSL |
| SSL_PORT_NO               | O                           | X<br/>On the client, connect with CONNTYPE = SSL; PORT = 20443 without a separate SSL port. |
| SSL_MAX_LISTEN            | O                           | X                                                            |
| SSL_CLIENT_AUTHENTICATION | O                           | X                                                            |
| SSL_CIPHER_LIST           | O                           | X                                                            |
| SSL_CA                    | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CAPATH                | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CERT                  | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_KEY                   | O                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_CIPHER                | X                           | O                                                            |
| SSL_VERIFY                | X                           | O                                                            |



##### Step 4: Set the Altibase Environment Variables(in case of using FIPS module)

To use FIPS module, users have to set the ALTIBASE_SSL_LOAD_CONFIG property in client environment variables to 1. Users who do not use FIPS module is able to skip this step.

| Name                     | Description                                                  | Default Value |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| ALTIBASE_SSL_LOAD_CONFIG | Specifies whether to load the OpenSSL configuration file.</br>* 0: Do not load the file</br> * 1: Load the file | 0             |



##### Step 5: Write a Client Program

Write a program to use SSL connection in the client application. You can find a sample program that uses SSL connection in the altibase directory. Please refer to $ALTIBASE_HOME/sample/SQLCLI/SSL.



#### How to Use OpenSSL FIPS Module

FIPS 140 is a program that verifies the security and reliability of encryption modules, and modules that have passed verification can be used by the U.S. federal government and related agencies. To use OpenSSL's FIPS module in Altibase, users can set it up in the following order.

1. Enable the FIPS module in the OpenSSL configuration file (see http://www.openssl.org/ )
2. Set the SSL_LOAD_CONFIG property of the Altibase server to 1.
3. Set the environment variable ALTIBASE_SSL_LOAD_CONFIG to 1 to allow the CLI application to use the FIPS module also.
