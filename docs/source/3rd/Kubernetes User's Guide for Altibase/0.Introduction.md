# Introduction

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration system that automates software deployment, scaling, and management. A Pod is the smallest execution unit in Kubernetes. This guide provides information on how to create an Altibase Pod using [Altibase container image](https://hub.docker.com/r/altibase/altibase) registered at Docker Hub and use it in the Kubernetes v1.20.4 environment. Please refer to the [Altibase Docker Guide](https://aid.altibase.com/display/arch/3.+Altibase+Docker+Image) for information on how to create Altibase docker image and the [Kubernetes website](https://kubernetes.io) for other Kubernetes features.
