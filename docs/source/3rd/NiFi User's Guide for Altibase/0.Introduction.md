# Introduction

This guide provides information on how to use Altibase in Apache NiFi (hereinafter NiFi ).

### What is NiFi?

NiFi is a software project from the Apache Software Foundation designed to automate the flow of data between software systems. For more information, please refer to the [NiFi website](https://nifi.apache.org/).

### NiFi Components

Below are the components of NiFi required to deliver the instructions in this document. Further details about other NiFi components can be found on the NiFi website.

- FlowFile
  - It represents a single piece of data in NiFi and it is consisted of two components: Attributes and Content.
  - It is more of an object that exists in memory rather than a physical file stored on disk.
- Processor
  - It is the basic blocks of controlling a Data Flow. It routes, transforms, or extracts information from FlowFiles.
  - NiFi has numerous processors with default installation and each processor has different functionality. The user can choose an appropriate processor according to their needs.
- Connection
  - It provides the linkage between processors.
- Controller Service
  - It is a set of shared resources that provide information processor needs based on the requirement.
  - For example, DB connection is used by multiple processors via controller service.
